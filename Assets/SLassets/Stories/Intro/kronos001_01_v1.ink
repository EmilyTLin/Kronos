// BLACK SCREEN:

???: We've been here before, {playername}. #align right
???: You know you can't win this, right? And, hey, maybe that's for the best - the "win" outcome is pretty twisted after all."

{playername}: What are you talking about? #align left

???: Tch, of course you don't understand. How could you? #align right

{playername}: We can still win. #align left

???: What "we"? There is no "we", anymore. You're welcome for that, by the way. #align right

{playername}: Fuck you. #align left

???: ... Y'know, that's fair. Given what you think you know. #align right
???: But you'll see, {playername}. When you see the outcome, you'll understand that this really is for the best.

{playername}: ... #align left
    
???: You kinda look like you wanna punch me right now... #align right
???: Or maybe you're just speechless? Maybe a bit of both? I was never great at reading you, {playername}.
    
{playername}: I'll stop you. #align left

???: What're you gonna do, {playername}? You're running out of juice. What're we at now? Like, eight-seven?  #align right

{playername}: ( Ninety... This'll probably beâ€¦ ) #align left #color blue

???: I'm betting... this'll be your last chance, huh?  #align right #color black

{playername}: ( She's right... I'm running on fumes at this point... ) #align left #color blue

{playername}: I'll stop you. #color black
{playername}: Even if that means I have to stop all of them, too.

{playername}: ( I hoped it wouldn't come to this... But you know what they say: Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. ) #color blue

You reach into your pocket. #color green

{playername}: ( This is my last chance... ) #color blue
